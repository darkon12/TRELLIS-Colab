# TRELLIS Colab
This is a notebook to use Microsoft TRELLIS https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS in Google Colab.
A Demo is already available in Huggingface https://huggingface.co/spaces/JeffreyXiang/TRELLIS but you can do just two or three generations before run out of credits.
If you don't have a powerful rig this is a good solution.
If you get some error in Gradio window (it may happen) just re-do the action or stop and re run the cell.
